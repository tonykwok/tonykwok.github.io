Profiling your application
==========================

Now that you know how to create non-trivial native Android apps, we want to make them run fast.
The first thing to do, before evaluating whether the application is fast enough, is to try 
building and running the project in the release mode, as opposed to the debug mode (see section
:ref:`Preparing for profiling <preparation>` below).
If that didn't give you enough speed-up, you will have to employ heavier tools.
To find the hot spots in your application and optimize them away, you have to profile the application code. 
There are several tools and approaches that will help you in profiling on Tegra-based devices.

#. If you already know where the bottleneck is, you need to measure 
   its execution time with a timer class as you optimize the bottleneck away.
   We provide a timer class implementation for your convenience.   

#. **Tegra profiler** is standard and default Tegra profiler. It offers a nice graphical user interface, but it only runs on Windows.
 
#. **PerfHUD ES** is a tool for debugging and profiling OpenGL ES 2.0 applications.

In this tutorial we will learn how to use the first and the second approach for the code
example ``SimpleImageOpenCV``.

For PerfHUD ES, we will use the last of the OpenGL ES tutorials, ``SimpleImageDisplayGL``.

.. _preparation:

Preparing for profiling
-----------------------
First of all, we need to check whether you have the profiling tools. If you chose
to install the complete version of TADP 2.0 you already have Tegra Profiler (on Windows)
and PerfHUD ES in your NVPACK folder.

For all the profilers you need to add these flags in the ``Application.mk`` file:
  
.. code-block:: make
   
   APP_CFLAGS += -fno-omit-frame-pointer -mno-thumb
 
If compiler optimizations are causing incorrect function backtraces,
you can add ``-g`` flag:

.. code-block:: make
   
    APP_CFLAGS += -fno-omit-frame-pointer -mno-thumb -g

We need to make sure your application is compiled in release mode. If you created build
configurations, right-click on the project's name in the in the *Project Explorer* pane,
then *Build Configuration > Set Active > Release*. Otherwise, right-click on the project's
name in the in the *Project Explorer* pane, then *Properties*; click on the *C/C++ Build*
entry in the left pane and look at the *Build Command* field: if it contains
``NDK_DEBUG = 1`` either remove it or set it to zero.

.. admonition:: Note
   
     You might find in the documentation for the profiling tools that another solution to the problem of incorrect backtraces
     is to compile your application in debug mode, using for instance the flag:
     
     .. code-block:: make
     
         APP_OPTIM := debug

     in the ``Android.mk`` file. We discourage you from doing this because profiling
     information gathered on un-optimized code does not correctly reflect the performance you 
     can expect if you let the compiler optimize the code.

Now, clean the project, compile it, and you're ready to start profiling. 


Tegra profiler
--------------
This tool is pretty easy to set up and use, therefore it is a recommended choice for Windows hosts.
There is a complete user guide that can be accessed from 
``$NVPACK_PATH\docs\index.xhtml`` but we'll go over the basics with a full example here.

Launch Tegra Profiler and start a new profiling report (*Analyze > Sample an Application...*)

.. image:: images/TegraProfiler_start_new.png
   :width: 338
   :scale: 100

Now in the ``Target`` field you should see your device. In the ``Package``
field select **Deploy to Device** and then select the apk file
that you want to profile. Since we are profiling our OpenCV example, the apk
file should be in
``<Your Workspace>\SimpleImageOpenCV\bin\SimpleImageOpenCV.apk``.
The workspace is probably in ``$NVPACK_PATH\nvsample_workspace`` if you copied
the files during import, or in ``\tutorials`` if you didn't.

.. image:: images/TegraProfiler_1.png
    :width: 500
    :scale: 100

Tegra Profiler can only profile applications that have been signed with NVIDIA's custom 
application signature.
The easiest way to solve this is to make Tegra Profiler sign the apk file
automatically: *Analyze > Options > Sign unsigned packages automatically*.

.. image:: images/TegraProfiler_signing.png
   :width: 500
   :scale: 100

To avoid conflicts with different signatures, in case you have the application
already installed, you should first uninstall it.  You can do it from a shell a shell::

  adb uninstall com.nvidia.tutorial

or you can do it from your device (*Settings > Applications > [Select app] > Uninstall*).

On Windows, if PowerShell is not in your system's path you need to add it (it is usually
located at: ``C:\WINDOWS\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0``). Otherwise you might get
the error::

  Windows cannot find 'PowerShell'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again.

We also need the Tegra Profiler daemon in order to profile. Tegra Profiler will install
it the first time it's run. So let's hit **Begin** and **OK** on the warning to let this
happen. We have to manually start the daemon the first time we use it, so you might get
an error such as (click on "Details" to see it)::

 Dynamic exception type: class AlibError
 std::exception::what: perf component not found

To start the daemon go in the applications pane, click on Tegra Profiler and hit the
**Start** button. If the button is greyed out, reboot your Android device and try again.  After the
daemon is running, click **Begin** again in the Tegra Profiler window, 
and you should see in the bottom right corner of the window that Tegra
Profiler is sampling:

.. image:: images/TegraProfiler_sampling.png
   :width: 214
   :scale: 100

On your device you should see the application running. Click on **CAM** and move the tablet
around. When you're done, hit the **Stop** button. Note that to get statistically
consistent results you should take at least a couple of minutes of sampling.
In the end you should see something like this:

.. image:: images/TegraProfiler_report1.png
   :width: 833
   :scale: 90 

From this report it is easy to see which functions required more time to run (the
percentages by the different function names), as well as the temporal distribution of
the different calls (in this example calls are mostly uniformly distributed). 

Using a timer class
-------------------
Sometimes, instead of sampling what function is being executed
and determining a rough percentage of time spent on different functions, you
need to get exact execution times of particular lines (or blocks) of 
the code. To this end, you can use timers. In this tutorial we provide you with a timer
class that allows you to do that, or you can write your own. If you are familiar
with Matlab's tic and toc functions you'll find yourself at home with this class.

Much like Matlab's timing functions, this timer saves the timestamps 
of successive calls of the function ``Timer::tic()`` in a stack. Subsequent
calls to ``Timer::toc()`` provide the time elapsed (in ms) from the last
``Timer::tic()`` call, and pop that timestamp from the stack. You can also
get the time in milliseconds since the construction of the timer by using
``Timer::get()``.

To see how to use the timer class, we will play again with the *SimpleImageOpenCV* example. 
Let's measure how long it takes to compute Fast features on your device. 
Copy ``Timer.cpp`` and ``Timer.h`` from ``/tutorials/SharedCode`` into
``<Your Workspace>/SimpleImageOpenCV/jni``. (If you copy them outside of Eclipse, you should
select ``jni`` folder and refresh with **F5** so you'll see them.)  Then, open 
``OpenCV_native.cpp``. Let's include a couple of headers in this file
(more information about logging can be found in :ref:`native_log`):

.. code-block:: c++

   #include "Timer.h"        // The timer class
   #include <android/log.h>  // We will use android's log to print the timing results
   // Let's define a tag called MyTimer so that we can filter logs later
   #define LOG(...) __android_log_print(ANDROID_LOG_VERBOSE, "MyTimer", __VA_ARGS__) 

We also need to add the timer source file to the list of source files in the ``Android.mk`` file:

.. code-block:: make

  LOCAL_SRC_FILES := main.cpp Engine.cpp DrawRect.cpp RectShader.cpp OpenCV_native.cpp Timer.cpp

Now let's find the chunk of code we want to analyze in ``OpenCV_native.cpp`` and let's
add a couple of lines to the function ``COpenCVSample::runLoadCVImg()``:

.. code-block:: c++
   
  // detect FAST features

  Timer t;
    
  t.tic(); // Start the timer    
    
  std::vector<cv::KeyPoint> v;
  cv::FastFeatureDetector detector(50);
  detector.detect(g_img, v);
    
  LOG("cv::FastFeatureDetector took %d ms to run.", t.toc()); // t.toc() gives the time in ms since t.tic()

Before we run the code, let's open the LogCat view in Eclipse to see the logs. Go to *Window >
Show View > LogCat*. If you don't see the LogCat option, go to *Window > Show View > Other...*
and look for LogCat. Now let's add a filter so that our logs don't get lost in a bunch of
clutter. Click on the plus symbol in the ``Filters`` pane:

.. image:: images/Timer_addFilter.png
   :width: 210
   :scale: 100

if you don't see the filter pane, you need to toggle the **Filter view** button:

.. image:: images/Timer_showFilters.png
   :width: 182
   :scale: 100

Finally name the filter and use the same tag we defined in the cpp file:

.. image:: images/Timer_settingFilter.png
   :width: 525
   :scale: 100

Now if we run the application on the device and select the option **IMAGE**, we should see
in the LogCat viewer something like the following (click on the image to enlarge):

.. image:: images/Timer_resultingTime.png
   :width: 1122
   :scale: 40


PerfHUD ES (Profiling OpenGL ES code)
-------------------------------------

PerfHUD ES is a complete tool for profiling and debugging OpenGL ES applications. It allows
to access performance information, as well as the call trace, mipmaps, etc.

If you chose to install the complete version of TADP 2.0 you already have PerfHUD ES 
in your NVPACK folder. In the same folder you can find a guide to its use. In order for
PerfHUD ES to be able to gather statistics, we have to first enable the target support.

Connect your device; then go to ``NVPACK_PATH/perfhud_switch`` folder and run the
file ``enable_perfhud.bat`` (in Linux or Mac ``enable_perfhud.sh``). Note that this script only
enables support until the device is rebooted, so you'll have to do it again if you turn
your device off.

Let us use the ``SimpleImageDisplayGL`` tutorial to learn the basics of the profiler. Because
of the way PerfHUD ES talks to the application, we need to recompile the project adding 
internet permission in ``AndroidManifest.xml``:

.. code-block:: make
  :emphasize-lines: 3
   
   <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.nvidia.tutorial"
    android:versionCode="1"
    android:versionName="1.0">
    
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    
    [...]

Now you can compile and run the application on your device.
Let's open LogCat and type NV in the search field. You should see the following messages (and a bunch more)::

  NV Interposer: nvdmInit called by perfhud
  NV Interposer: NVPerfHUD ES is active.
  NV Interposer: Communication layer init succeed, listen on port 7876.

.. note::
  If you have a firewall software installed on your host machine you might have to open the
  port indicated in the LogCat as shown above to allow PerfHUD ES to communicate with
  the application on your Tegra device.

We can now start PerfHUD ES. You should see a screen like the one below:

.. image:: images/Perf_start.png
   :width: 1166
   :scale: 50

The first graph shows the CPU load for the different CPUs, the second shows a bunch of
statistics. You can choose to show/hide any of these statistics by clicking on their name
below the graph. Let's switch to the *Frame Debugger* mode (second button on the left-hand
frame):

.. image:: images/Perf_FrameDebugger.png
   :width: 1928
   :scale: 50
   
There are several tabs at the top. The currently active tab (`Frame Scrubber`) shows the
content of the frame buffer at the time of different draw calls. In the current view, the
word *OFF* should be blinking: that was the element that was drawn by the current call.
At the bottom of the window you will see a scroll-bar (circled in red in the
figure above). Right above it you will see the call to ``glDrawElements()``. If you drag 
the bar back one step by 3 steps you will see that the background was rendered (hopefully
you will not get an attack of epilepsy) with the call ``glDrawElements()``.

Note that this bar is common to all the `Frame Scrubber` tabs. For instance, if you go
to the  `Texture Viewer` you can use it to change between different draw calls and see
the corresponding textures (it should flip between the background image and different sets
of fonts). When you look at mipmaps you can actually click on any of the different levels
and 

The most interesting tab is probably the `Shader Viewer` tab.  Here you can see what shaders
are called and when. In our example, we do not precompile the shaders so we can see the
code, interact with it, and even change it at run-time!

Let's look at the top-left pane:

.. image:: images/Perf_ShaderViewer.png
   :width: 442 
   :scale: 100

Note that the actual numbers of the programs might be different in the window you are looking
at. In this case, *program 3* is relative to the text we've drawn on the screen (the two buttons 
and the timer) and was therefore used by the last three draw calls (as indicated by "3-5" in
the *Used by Draw Call* column). Since the scroll-bar at the bottom is all the way to the left,
this program is shown as active (light blue). Note that you can click on any of the attributes or 
uniforms to see values and information.
Now use the navigation bar to go back to the second draw call and you will see that program 9, 
which is relative to the background texture, becomes active.  The fragment and vertex shaders 
shown in the right pane are ``plain.frag`` and ``plain.vert`` from our code.

Let's go on the device and hit the **ON** button in the example application; PerfHUD ES will
not update this view automatically, we need to hit the button to *Capture next frame*, indicated by the red circle in this screenshot:

.. image:: images/Perf_NewFrame.png
   :width: 186 
   :scale: 100
   
Now the shaders in the right pane are our ``filter.vert`` and ``filter.frag``. Note that, if you click 
on uniforms within the code you will be able to see information about it in the left panes.
Let's go to the fragment shader, and change the sobel filter to be from vertical to horizontal.
Click the **Edit Shader** button and replace the first 6 lines of the main function with:
   
.. code-block:: c++

    gl_FragColor  =       texture2D( uTex, vTexCoord + vec2(  uD.x,  uD.y ) );
    gl_FragColor += 2.0 * texture2D( uTex, vTexCoord + vec2(  uD.x,  0.0  ) );
    gl_FragColor +=       texture2D( uTex, vTexCoord + vec2(  uD.x, -uD.y ) );
    gl_FragColor -=       texture2D( uTex, vTexCoord + vec2( -uD.x,  uD.y ) );
    gl_FragColor -= 2.0 * texture2D( uTex, vTexCoord + vec2( -uD.x,  0.0  ) );
    gl_FragColor -=       texture2D( uTex, vTexCoord + vec2( -uD.x, -uD.y ) );

Then hit **Compile and Apply**. Look at the screen of your device and you should see that
now the screen has changed:

.. image:: images/Perf_NewShader.png
   :width: 1280
   :scale: 60

PerfHUD ES is also a powerful profiling tool. However, aside from the information
provided in the *Performance Dashboard* tab, the profiling data is only available
for specific system images and, therefore, we will not cover those capabilities
here.

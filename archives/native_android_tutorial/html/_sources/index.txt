Native Development on NVIDIA Android Devices
============================================

This documentation gives you a roadmap and tutorial on how to do visual computing in C++ on Android.
We will not cover much Java development here, for that see http://developer.android.com, but we do cover
how Java and C/C++ interact via JNI (Java Native Interface).
Most of this document is relevant for native (C/C++) development on any Android device,
some only on NVIDIA Tegra devices, and even a smaller subset only on NVIDIA Cardhu developer board.

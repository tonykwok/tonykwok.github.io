      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <h3>#01: June 2011 ~ present, Sony Mobile Communications Inc.</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Camera application new feature development:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Voice-guided self-portrait: according to the face location calculated by face detection engine in the camera viewfinder,
        guide the user how to move the phone (e.g. left, up, right, and down) via voice and trigger a capture when face locates
        in a proper position automatically.</p>
      <p>Sound photo: capture a much more playful photo with sound embedded in it. The sound data is stored in JPEG file’s EXIF
        APP2 section, not a separating file, so it is much easier to transfer and share among different devices.</p>
      <p>Real-time face beauty: apply various effects like Distortion, Vignette, Kaleidoscope, etc. on camera’s preview frame
        buffer (YUV format) before sending it to graphics module to complete rendering and compositing. There are mainly
        2 different solutions to achieve this: GPU or CPU. Both of them are implemented, compared and finally, CPU solution
        was chosen since it is more performant and less power consumption.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>GPU: This solution is much power consuming and the device becomes hot quickly because it uses OpenGL ES2.0 shader
          to do the YUV-RGB conversion first and then uses GL to render the RGB frame on GLSurfaceView.</li>
        <li>CPU: Just need to get the backend graphics buffer of the SurfaceView and then copy the post-processed YUV frame to
          it directly without color conversion. Since this solution uses CPU to do compositing, it consumes less power than
          GPU solution, and thermal won’t increase quickly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Camera performance improvement:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Camera View layout was so complicated that impacted launch speed. By investigating the camera view layout hierarchies,
        I found that there were so many redundant/unnecessary views: one kind of them could be removed, and another kind
        of them could be merged, and the rest of them should use lazy loading approach. It’s not an easy job since any changes
        should not cause degrades, but it's worth it. Finally, our camera app launches much more quickly than before even
        for cold boot case.</p>

      <h3>#02: July 2009-June 2011, Kingdee Software Co., Ltd.</h3>
      <p>EAS (Enterprise Application Suite based on Kingdee Business Operating System) is a Client-Server based ERP software.
        On the client side, the UI is built with Java Swing, we enrich the existing Swing both with extensions as well as
        brand new ones to meet our special requirement, such as KingdeeTable, F7BizPromptBox and so on; On the server side,
        we adopt Java EE technologies and our own application server – Apusic, the fourth application server that passes
        Java EE 5.0 certification in the world. During this period, I was responsible for Manufacture Module design and development,
        including Production Line Scheduling, Manufacture Order Split and Reform, and so on.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>#01: Java Class File Encryption</h3>
      <p>Most Obfuscators only rename the identifiers in java class file. As such, it does nothing but makes the files decompiled
        by Java Decompilers much more difficult to read. Considering these limits, I overwrite the ClassLoader and use Java
        Native Interface to convert the byte array into Java class, because the main part is written in C, this approach
        puts the security on a level comparable to software written in a native language.</p>
      <h3>#02: Content-Based Image Retrieval System</h3>
      <p>A CBIR library which I implemented in Java based on the thesis:
        <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/jacobs-1995.pdf"></a>"Fast Multi-Resolution Image Querying, Charles E. Jacobs, Adam Frinkelstein, David H. Salesin" for Material Management
        System to help users finding the most similar materials corresponding to the image they provided efficiently.</p>
      <h3>#03: Expression Evaluation on Android Platform</h3>
      <p>A tool for evaluating expressions of type string, e.g.
        <code>double value = eval("3.14 * (3 ^ 2) - (3 / 2) * 2");</code> As we all know there is an eval function in JavaScript and Android supports JavaScript as well, but unfortunately,
        <code>WebView.loadUrl()</code> has no return value, so we used a customized WebChromeClient and got the result through the
        <code>boolean onJsAlert(WebView view, String url, String message, JsResult result)</code> callback.</p>
      <h3>#04: Alloy Look and Feel Improvement and Enhancement</h3>
      <p>Alloy Look and Feel is a pluggable java look and feel that can be used by Java developers to enhance the appearance
        and atmosphere of their Java Swing applications (e.g.
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Jetbrains&reg; IntelliJ IDEA</a>). It is developed by the
        <a href="http://lookandfeel.incors.com/">INCORS&reg;</a> Corporation and they have stopped supporting it since version 1.4.4, I fixed some known bugs and
        customized it to meet the aesthetic standard of mine.
      </p>
      <h3>#05: Regex4j</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/tonykwok/regex4j">Regex4j</a> is a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regular Expression Engine</a> ported from the
        <code>System.Text.RegularExpressions</code> module of
        <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx">Microsoft's .Net Core Project</a>
        for Java platform. As a compensation for the Java built-in Pattern class, with one of its advantages, you can avoid the
        <code>StackOverflowError</code> issues (
        <a href="http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6337993">JDK-6337993</a>,
        <a href="http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6882582">JDK-6882582</a> and
        <a href="http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8078476">JDK-8078476</a>), which have existed in the
        <code>java.util.regex</code> package since Java 1.4 and still not fixed in the latest JDK.</p>

      <h3>#06: Primitive</h3>
      <p>Primitive is a Java Swing desktop app and open source library for geometrizing images into shapes. Using only geometric
        primitives like rectangles, triangles, and ellipses, the software recreates images as abstract arrangements of shapes.
        This project was ported from the popular and excellent work of
        <a href="https://www.michaelfogleman.com/projects/primitive/">Michael Fogleman - Reproducing images with geometric primitives.</a> The original implementation is written in Go,
        I ported it to Java and implemented an antialiasing rasterizer based on the same area/coverage accumulation algorithm
        as the
        <a href="https://github.com/golang/freetype/blob/master/raster/raster.go">Freetype</a> "smooth" module and the
        <a href="http://www.antigrain.com/">Anti-Grain Geometry
        </a> library.</p>
